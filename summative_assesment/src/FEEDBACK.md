This is a well-structured locker rental system that demonstrates good understanding of basic Java concepts including classes, objects, encapsulation, and method design. The code shows clear separation of concerns with distinct classes for different responsibilities.

OVERALL: Revision Requested

Minor Issues:

* **Excessive blank lines**: Remove the large block of empty lines in the switch statement (around case 4).

* **Logic Issue**: In your LockerService, you receive a capacity and configure the locker array size, but in the `releaseLocker()` method you hard code the max:

  ```java
  // shouldn't this be capacity? not 10?
  int lockerNumber = io.getInt("\nEnter your locker number: ", 1, 10);
  ```

* **Magic numbers**: Consider using constants or enums for menu options instead of hardcoded numbers. (This isn't a big deal, but your code is good enough that I want to up you to the "next level"). If you don't want to use enums, you can create constants like this in the Main file:

  ```java
  private static final int RENT_LOCKER = 1;
  private static final int ACCESS_LOCKER = 2;
  private static final int RELEASE_LOCKER = 3;
  private static final int EXIT = 4;
  ```

* **"Complex Method"**: The releaseLocker() method is pretty complex to read. This would be an opportunity to move some of those conditions into private methods for readability purposes.

* **Terminal access in LockerService**: Ideally, we don't put methods directly into the service class that talk to the terminal, later on this will make our class harder/impossible to test. You don't need to change anything now, but the command pattern I've been showing you this week fixes that, so going forward just try to avoid this.
